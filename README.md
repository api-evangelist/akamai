### Akamai Access Revocation API
Adaptive Media Delivery supports Token Authentication. You can apply it to generate unique tokens and include them in requests for your content. Akamai validates these tokens to grant access to your media. Access Revocation lets you recognize tokens that have been hijacked and flag them to block requests that include them. Use the Access Revocation API to generate a revocation list of these tokens. You can also set a time to live for this revocation period to automatically unrevoke these tokens, or you can manually remove them from a revocation list. The API also lets you review your revocation lists and Access Revocation settings.
