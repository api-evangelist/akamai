    description: >-
      The Hosted Login, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect APIs represent your
      primary toolset for managing Hosted Login. Most Hosted Login management
      tasks can only be carried out by using API calls. Keep in mind, too that
      some Hosted Login management tasks, such as managing two-factor
      authentication messages, or creating, modifying, and deleting Hosted Login
      links, require the use of other operations. For example, you need to use
      the Configuration API to manage two-factor authentication messages or
      Hosted Login Links.
